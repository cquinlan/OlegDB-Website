Heres a website for you troubles. You'll need python3 because I use the
`print()` syntax rather than the `print ` syntax.

Installation
============
````
./build.py
rsync -Pavz built/* you@sick.website.org:/var/www/sick_website/
````

Man that was easy. Oh wait you'll need the `static/` directory too, so throw
that in there too.
